`π:4` is a journey in data science. Look at it as a notebook where a student continually collects learning material and keeps the helpful ones. `π:4` is one fourth of `π` radian or `45°`. In material science, mechanical engineering, mathematics and physics, `45°` has its own meaning. Here, I use π:4 to reflect on the multidisciplinary synergy in data science[.](docs-blog-/)
